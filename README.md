# Pandemonium
 
Pandemonium is an alpha staggered ISO pcb with KLE by HaiZeus#0411. It uses an [XIAO nRF52840](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-BLE-nRF52840-p-5201.html) for bluetooth support. The desgin for that is based on [NoahK#1290's](https://kiserdesigns.bigcartel.com/) [Asymptote](https://github.com/KiserDesigns/Asymptote).
